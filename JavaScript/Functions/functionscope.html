//For example, say you have an HTML file that is calling in two external JavaScript files, and both of 
//them have a variable and a function defined that use the same name:

//HTML
//Copy to Clipboard
<!-- Excerpt from my HTML -->
<script src="first.js"></script>
<script src="second.js"></script>
<script>
  greeting();
</script>
JS
Copy to Clipboard
// first.js
const name = "Chris";
function greeting() {
  alert(`Hello ${name}: welcome to our company.`);
}
JS
Copy to Clipboard
// second.js
const name = "Zaptec";
function greeting() {
  alert(`Our company is called ${name}.`);
}
//Both functions you want to call are called greeting(), but you can only ever access the first.js file's 
//greeting() function (the second one is ignored). In addition, an error results when attempting 
//(in the second.js file) to assign a new value to the name variable â€” because it was already declared 
//with const, and so can't be reassigned.
